# Containerized Consumer Driven Contracts

This demo will walk you through the following steps:

1. Starting a provider service (express API)
1. Running a consumer application (node client)
1. Publishing a contract by a consumer
1. Exercising the contract against a provider

## Prerequisites

* Docker

## Provider

This is a simple HTTP server with a single endpoint **GET \\** returning a hardcoded JSON body. In this section we will start the API and exercise it's endpoint.

### Running

Go into the provider directory:

```shell
make provider
```

This will build a Docker image for the *Provider* and start a container.

At this point, the server is running. In order to simulate a real-life scenario of the server running in the cloud, a tunneling service ([ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)) has been used.

The output will give you a publicly accessible endpoint for the service (e.g. https://c0587a05.ngrok.io)

You can exercise the endpoint in the following way:

```bash
curl https://c0587a05.ngrok.io
```

You should see the following response:

```json
{
  "name": {
    "first": "Daniel",
    "last": "Siwiec",
    "nick": "Dan"
  }
}
```

## Consumer

The *Consumer* is an application relying on the *Provider* for it's functionality. In this section we will run the consumer client application, as well as run contract tests against the provider.

### Running

The consumer application needs the provider's endpoint. It'll be passed through an environment variable like this (put in the correct ngrok endpoint for the provider):

```shell
PROVIDER_URL=https://973bddfd.ngrok.io make consumer
```

This command build a consumer image and runs the container, passing in the endpoint as an environment variable.

You should see a similar output to this:

```shell
His first name is Daniel, but he goes by Dan
```

## Publishing and exercising the contract
In this section, we will do the following:

1. (Consumer) Build and publish the contract test Docker image
1. (Provider) Run the contract tests against the instance

### Build and publish the contract image

Go to the contract folder:

```shell
make contract-build
```

This will build a Docker image with the contract tests

### Exercise the contract against the provider

Start a container to run the contract tests and pass the PROVIDER_URL variable:

```shell
PROVIDER_URL=https://973bddfd.ngrok.io make contract-run
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```shell
PASS tests/name.test.js
  Name service
    âœ“ should have the right schema (569ms)
