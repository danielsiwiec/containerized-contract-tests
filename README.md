# Containerized Consumer Driven Contracts

This demo will walk you through the following steps:

1. Starting a provider service (express API)
1. Running a consumer application (node client)
1. Publishing a contract by a consumer
1. Exercising the contract against a provider

## Prerequisites

* Docker
* Node 10 or higher

## Provider

This is a simple HTTP server with a single endpoint **GET \\** returning a hardcoded JSON body. In this section we will start the API and exercise it's endpoint.

### Running

Go into the provider directory:

```shell
cd provider
```

Install node modules:

```shell
npm install
```

Run the service:

```shell
npm start
```

At this point, the server is running. In order to simulate a real-life scenario of the server running in the cloud, a tunneling service ([ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)) has been used.

The output of the `start` command will give you a publicly accessible endpoint for the service (e.g. https://c0587a05.ngrok.io)

You can exercise the endpoint in the following way:

```bash
curl https://c0587a05.ngrok.io
```

You should see the following response:

```json
{
  "name": {
    "first": "Daniel",
    "last": "Siwiec",
    "nick": "Dan"
  }
}
```

## Consumer

The **Consumer** is an application relying on the **Provider** for it's functionality. In this section we will run the consumer client application, as well as run contract tests against the provider.

### Running

Go into the consumer directory:

```shell
cd consumer
```

Install node modules:
```shell
npm install
```

The consumer application needs the provider's endpoint. It'll be passed through an environment variable like this (put in the correct ngrok endpoint for the provider):

```shell
PROVIDER_URL=https://4e9d9e28.ngrok.io npm start
```

You should see a similar output to this:

```
His first name is Daniel, but he goes by Dan
```

### Tests
This is how to run the tests directly on the host machine (not through Docker).

Go into the test folder:

```shell
cd contract-tests
```

Install node modules:
```shell
npm install
```

Run the tests, again by passing the service endpoint
```
cd 
PROVIDER_URL=https://4e9d9e28.ngrok.io jest
```


## Publishing and exercising the contract
In this section, we will do the following:

1. (Consumer) Build and publish the contract test Docker image
1. (Provider) Run the contract tests against the instance

### Build and publish the contract image

Go to the contract folder:

```shell
cd consumer\contract-tests
```

Build and tag the image:

```shell
docker build . -t consumer-contract
```

### Exercise the contract against the provider

Start a container from the image and pass in the correct provider url:

```shell
docker run \
-e PROVIDER_URL=https://4e9d9e28.ngrok.io \
consumer-contract
```

You should see output similar to this:

```shell
PASS tests/name.test.js
  Name service
    âœ“ should have the right schema (569ms)
